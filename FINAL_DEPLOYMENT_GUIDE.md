# 🚀 Final Deployment Guide - Import Feature

## ✅ What Has Been Configured

### 1. **GraphQL Schema Updated**
- ✅ Added 6 new fields to Task type:
  - `startDate: AWSDateTime`
  - `durationHours: Float`
  - `completionPercentage: Int`
  - `completedAt: AWSDateTime`
  - `workHours: Float`
  - `billingType: String`

- ✅ Added import mutation:
  - `importTasksFromExcel(projectId: ID!, fileKey: String!): ImportResult`

- ✅ Added import result types:
  - `ImportResult`
  - `ImportError`

### 2. **Lambda Function Configured**
- ✅ File: `amplify/backend/function/importTasks/index.js`
- ✅ Handles Excel file parsing
- ✅ Creates tasks in DynamoDB
- ✅ Maps Zoho columns to SQUAD PM fields
- ✅ Returns success/error results

### 3. **Frontend Updated**
- ✅ File: `client/src/components/ImportTasksModal.js`
- ✅ Uses Amplify Storage for file upload
- ✅ Calls GraphQL mutation
- ✅ Displays import results

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Changes
```bash
cd C:\Users\mail2\Downloads\ProjectManagement
amplify status
```

**You should see:**
```
| Category | Resource name | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Api      | squadpm       | Update    | awscloudformation |
| Function | importTasks   | Create    | awscloudformation |
```

### Step 2: Deploy to AWS
```bash
amplify push
```

**Answer the prompts:**
- ✅ Are you sure you want to continue? **Yes**
- ✅ Do you want to update code for your updated GraphQL API? **Yes**
- ✅ Do you want to generate GraphQL statements? **Yes**

**This will:**
1. Update DynamoDB tables with new fields
2. Deploy Lambda function
3. Update AppSync API
4. Generate GraphQL code
5. Build and deploy frontend

**Wait time:** 5-10 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
amplify console
```

Navigate to:
- **API (GraphQL)** → Check schema has new fields
- **Functions** → Verify `importTasks` exists
- **Storage** → Verify S3 bucket exists

## 📋 Column Mapping Reference

Your Excel data will map as follows:

| Excel Column | SQUAD PM Field | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Task Name | title | "Manage Users/Employee" |
| Owner | assignedToId | "Abhinandan R" → user.id |
| Custom Status | status | "Scope Defined" → "TODO" |
| Tags | tags | "Company Settings" → ["Company Settings"] |
| Start Date | startDate | (empty) → null |
| Due Date | dueDate | (empty) → null |
| Duration | durationHours | "-" → null |
| Priority | priority | "High" → "HIGH" |
| Created By | createdById | "Abhinandan R" → user.id |
| % Completed | completionPercentage | "0" → 0 |
| Completion Date | completedAt | "-" → null |
| Work hours | workHours | "00:00" → 0 |
| Billing Type | billingType | "None" → "None" |

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Upload Excel File
1. Go to your Amplify URL
2. Navigate to Kanban Board
3. Click "Import Tasks"
4. Upload your Excel file (52 tasks)
5. Click "Import Tasks"

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Successfully imported 52 tasks!
```

### Test 2: Verify Tasks Created
1. Check Kanban board
2. Tasks should appear in "To Do" column
3. Click on a task to verify fields:
   - Title: "Manage Users/Employee"
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Tags: ["Company Settings"]
   - Billing Type: "None"

### Test 3: Check CloudWatch Logs
```bash
amplify console
# Navigate to: Functions → importTasks → View logs
```

**Look for:**
```
Processing 52 tasks from Excel
Created task: Manage Users/Employee
Created task: Department and Roles
...
Import completed: 52 success, 0 failed
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "importTasksFromExcel is not defined"
**Cause:** Schema not deployed
**Fix:** Run `amplify push` again

### Issue 2: "Access Denied" on S3
**Cause:** Storage not configured
**Fix:**
```bash
amplify add storage
# Choose: Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
# Auth users only
# create, read, delete permissions
amplify push
```

### Issue 3: Lambda Timeout
**Cause:** Too many tasks or slow processing
**Fix:** Already configured for 300 seconds (5 minutes)

### Issue 4: Tasks Not Appearing
**Cause:** User matching failed
**Fix:** 
- "Unassigned User" won't match anyone (expected)
- "Abhinandan R" needs to exist in project members
- Tasks still created, just without assignee

---

## 📊 Expected Import Results

With your 52 tasks:

**Success Scenarios:**
- ✅ All 52 tasks created
- ✅ Tags parsed correctly
- ✅ Priority mapped (High→HIGH, Medium→MEDIUM, Low→LOW)
- ✅ Status set to "TODO" (or "Scope Defined" if you keep it)
- ✅ Billing type preserved

**Expected Warnings:**
- ⚠️ "Unassigned User" → No assignee (tasks created without assignment)
- ⚠️ Empty dates → null values
- ⚠️ "-" in duration → 0 or null

**No Failures Expected** (all tasks should import successfully)
