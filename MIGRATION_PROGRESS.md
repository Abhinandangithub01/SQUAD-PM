## 🚀 Deployment 31 Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. `client/src/services/amplifyDataService.js` - NEW
2. `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js` - UPDATED
3. `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - NEW
4. `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md` - NEW

**Expected Results After Deployment:**
- Dashboard will show "0 Projects, 0 Tasks" (real data from DynamoDB)
- No more "backend server is not running" error on Dashboard
- Dashboard loads successfully
- Stats are calculated from actual database

**To Test:**
1. Login to app
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Should see real stats (0 projects, 0 tasks initially)
4. Try to create a project (will still fail - next phase)

## 📝 Next Deployment (32) Will Include:

1. Projects page migration
2. CreateProjectModal migration
3. Ability to create projects in DynamoDB
4. Ability to view projects from DynamoDB
