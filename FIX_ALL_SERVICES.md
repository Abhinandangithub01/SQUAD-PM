# Fix All Service Type Issues

The Amplify generated types have incorrect type definitions (expecting string[] instead of string).

## Pattern to Fix

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
const { data, errors } = await client.models.Model.create({
  field1: value1,
  field2: value2,
});
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
const modelData: any = {
  field1: value1,
  field2: value2,
};
const { data, errors } = await client.models.Model.create(modelData);
```

## Files Already Fixed
- ✅ attachmentService.ts
- ✅ commentService.ts

## Files That May Need Fixing
- activityLogService.ts
- notificationService.ts
- projectMemberService.ts
- timeTrackingService.ts

These will fail during build if they have the same issue.
