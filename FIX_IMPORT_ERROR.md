# 🔧 Fix Import Error - Step by Step

## Error You're Seeing
```
Failed to import tasks
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
GET http://localhost:3001/api/import/tasks/[projectId] 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Cause
The `xlsx` package is not installed on the server, so the import route cannot load.

---

## ✅ Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install xlsx Package
Open a **new terminal** and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\mail2\Downloads\ProjectManagement\server
npm install xlsx
```

**Expected output:**
```
added 1 package, and audited X packages in Xs
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
Check that xlsx was added to package.json:

```powershell
# Still in the server directory
cat package.json
```

You should see `"xlsx": "^0.18.5"` in the dependencies.

### Step 3: Restart Server
**IMPORTANT:** You must restart your server for the changes to take effect.

```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then start it again:
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
Server running on port 5000
Environment: development
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

1. Refresh your browser (F5)
2. Go to Kanban Board
3. Click "Import Tasks" button
4. Upload your Excel file
5. Click "Import Tasks"

**Should work now!** ✅

## 🔍 Additional Checks

### If Still Getting 404 Error

**Check 1: Verify import.js exists**
```powershell
ls C:\Users\mail2\Downloads\ProjectManagement\server\routes\import.js
```

**Check 2: Verify route is registered**
Open `server\index.js` and look for this line (around line 56):
```javascript
app.use('/api/import', require('./routes/import'));
```

**Check 3: Check server logs**
Look at your server terminal for any errors when it starts up.

### If Getting "Amplify not configured" Error

This means the frontend is trying to use AWS Amplify. The ImportTasksModal should NOT import from 'aws-amplify/storage'.

**Fix:** The ImportTasksModal.js has already been updated to use axios instead of Amplify.

## 🎯 Quick Verification Commands

Run these to verify everything is set up:

```powershell
# 1. Check if xlsx is installed
cd C:\Users\mail2\Downloads\ProjectManagement\server
npm list xlsx

# 2. Check if import route exists
ls routes\import.js

# 3. Check if route is registered in index.js
Select-String -Path "index.js" -Pattern "api/import"
```

## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not Restarting Server
**Problem:** Installing xlsx but not restarting the server.
**Solution:** Always restart after installing new packages.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Directory
**Problem:** Running `npm install xlsx` in the wrong directory.
**Solution:** Must be in the `server` directory, not root.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Old Browser Cache
**Problem:** Browser cached the old error.
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache.
