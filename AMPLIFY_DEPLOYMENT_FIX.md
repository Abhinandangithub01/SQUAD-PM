# 🔧 Amplify Deployment Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Error: `npm ci` Failed
**Problem**: Amplify build was failing with `npm ci` command because package-lock.json was gitignored.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Changed `amplify.yml` to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
- ✅ Removed `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore`
- ✅ Added `package-lock.json` to repository

### 2. Backend Deployment Removed (Temporary)
**Problem**: Backend deployment command was causing issues in Amplify build.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Simplified `amplify.yml` to focus on frontend only
- ✅ Backend will be deployed separately using `npx ampx sandbox`

## 📋 Current amplify.yml

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - .next/cache/**/*
      - node_modules/**/*
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Locally

The backend needs to be deployed separately before the frontend can work:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Deploy backend to AWS (creates Cognito, AppSync, DynamoDB, S3)
npx ampx sandbox --once

# Or for persistent sandbox
npx ampx sandbox
```

This will:
- ✅ Create AWS Cognito User Pool
- ✅ Create AppSync GraphQL API
- ✅ Create DynamoDB Tables
- ✅ Create S3 Bucket
- ✅ Generate `amplify_outputs.json`

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend via Amplify Console

The frontend will now build successfully in Amplify:

1. **Go to AWS Amplify Console**
2. **Trigger a new build** (or it will auto-trigger from the push)
3. **Monitor the build logs**
4. **Wait for deployment to complete**

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed:
1. ✅ Visit your Amplify URL
2. ✅ Check if the app loads
3. ✅ Note: Authentication won't work until backend is deployed

## 🔄 Two-Phase Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Frontend Only (Current)
- ✅ Frontend deploys to Amplify Hosting
- ✅ Static Next.js application
- ❌ No backend functionality yet

### Phase 2: Full Stack (Next)
After backend is deployed locally:
1. Backend resources are created in AWS
2. `amplify_outputs.json` is generated
3. Frontend can connect to backend
4. Full authentication and data features work

## 📝 Alternative: Full Automated Deployment

If you want Amplify to deploy both frontend and backend automatically, you'll need to:

1. **Set up Amplify Gen 2 CI/CD**:
   ```yaml
   version: 1
   backend:
     phases:
       build:
         commands:
           - npm install
           - npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID
   frontend:
     phases:
       preBuild:
         commands:
           - npm install
       build:
         commands:
           - npm run build
     artifacts:
       baseDirectory: .next
       files:
         - '**/*'
   ```

2. **Configure Amplify Service Role**:
   - Go to Amplify Console → App Settings → General
   - Add a service role with permissions for:
     - Cognito
     - AppSync
     - DynamoDB
     - S3
     - CloudFormation

3. **Set Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - `AWS_BRANCH`
   - `AWS_APP_ID`

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: Build error resolved
✅ **Pushed**: Changes pushed to CodeCommit
✅ **Ready**: Frontend will now build successfully

⏳ **Next**: Deploy backend separately with `npx ampx sandbox`
