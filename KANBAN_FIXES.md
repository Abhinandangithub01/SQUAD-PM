# 🔧 Kanban Board Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Issues Fixed**: Delete Task Option + Light/Faded Card After Move

---

## ✅ **Issue 1: Add Delete Task Option**

### **Problem**
- No option to delete tasks from Kanban board
- Users had to go to task details to delete

### **Solution** ✅
Added a delete button to each task card that appears on hover:

**Location**: Task card header (next to "Send to Chat" button)

**Features**:
- 🗑️ Red trash icon
- Appears on card hover
- Confirmation dialog before delete
- Removes task from UI and database
- Success toast notification

**Code Added**:
```javascript
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    handleDeleteTask(task.id);
  }}
  className="opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 p-1 rounded text-gray-400 hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50 transition-all duration-200"
  title="Delete Task"
>
  <TrashIcon className="h-3 w-3" />
</button>
```

**How to Use**:
1. Hover over any task card
2. Click the red trash icon in top-right
3. Confirm deletion
4. Task is deleted from database and UI

## ✅ **Issue 2: Light/Faded Card After Move**

### **Problem**
- After dragging a task to new column, card became very light/faded
- Looked disabled or processing
- Opacity was stuck at 30% (opacity-30 class)

### **Root Cause**
- During drag, card opacity set to 30% (`draggedTask?.id === task.id ? 'opacity-30' : 'opacity-100'`)
- After drop, `draggedTask` state wasn't reset immediately
- Cleanup timeout happened after re-render, causing stuck opacity

### **Solution** ✅
Fixed the timing and state management:

**Changes Made**:
1. **Reset draggedTask immediately** after drop (before cleanup)
2. **Set explicit opacity to 1** in cleanup (not empty string)
3. **Reduced timeout** from 150ms to 50ms

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE
setDragOverColumn(null);
setTimeout(() => {
  card.style.opacity = '';
}, 150);

// AFTER
setDraggedTask(null);      // ✅ Reset immediately
setDragOverColumn(null);
setTimeout(() => {
  card.style.opacity = '1'; // ✅ Explicit value
}, 50);                      // ✅ Faster cleanup
```

**Result**:
- Cards maintain full opacity after move
- No more faded/disabled appearance
- Smooth transitions

## 🎨 **How It Works Now**

4. Confirm in dialog
5. Task removed successfully

### **Move Task**
1. Drag task to new column
2. Drop in target column
3. Card moves with full opacity ✅
