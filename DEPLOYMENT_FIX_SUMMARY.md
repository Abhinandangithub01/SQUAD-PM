# 🚀 Deployment Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Package Lock Mismatch** ✅
- **Problem**: `npm ci` failing because package-lock.json was out of sync
- **Solution**: Ran `npm install` and committed updated package-lock.json
- **Commit**: `0de7d8d` - fix: update package-lock.json for xlsx dependency

### 2. **Wrong Model Reference** ✅
- **Problem**: Code was calling `client.models.User.list()` but schema has `UserProfile`
- **Solution**: Changed to `client.models.UserProfile.list()`
- **Commit**: `3ac32a6` - fix: update schema with import fields and fix UserProfile model reference

### 3. **Missing Task Fields for Import** ✅
- **Problem**: Import functionality needed additional fields not in schema
- **Solution**: Added to Task model:
  - `startDate` (AWSDateTime)
  - `estimatedHours` (Float)
  - `actualHours` (Float)
  - `progressPercentage` (Int)
  - `completedAt` (AWSDateTime)
- **File**: `client/amplify/data/resource.ts`

### 4. **Import Modal Field Mapping** ✅
- **Problem**: ImportTasksModal was using incorrect field types
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed tags from JSON string to array
  - Added default `createdById`
  - Fixed date handling (undefined instead of null)
  - Added columnId and position
- **File**: `client/src/components/ImportTasksModal.js`
