## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Problem:** Email verification UI not appearing on login page when user is unverified

**Expected Behavior:**
1. User tries to login with unverified account
2. Red alert box appears below Sign in button
3. Shows "Account Not Verified" message
4. Button to send verification code
5. Input field for 6-digit code
6. Verify button to confirm

**Actual Behavior:**
- Error occurs in console: "User is not confirmed"
- No UI alert appears
- User cannot verify account from login page

## 📋 Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Wait for Deployment
1. Check AWS Amplify Console
2. Ensure Deployment 29 completed successfully
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. Try login again

### Option 2: Manual Verification (Temporary)
1. Go directly to: https://main.d8tv3j2hk2i9r.amplifyapp.com/verify-email
2. Won't work without email in state
3. **Better:** Register a NEW account and verify immediately

### Option 3: Verify via AWS Cognito Console
1. Go to AWS Console → Cognito
2. Find user pool
3. Find user: mail2abhinandan01@gmail.com
4. Manually confirm the user
5. Then login will work

## 🐛 Debugging

**To check if new code is deployed:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try to login with unverified account
3. Look for these logs:
   - `Login result: {success: false, error: "..."}`
   - `Error message: user is not confirmed.`
   - `Setting unverified email: mail2abhinandan01@gmail.com`

**If logs appear but no UI:**
- React state issue
- Check React DevTools

**If logs don't appear:**
- Code not deployed yet
- Clear cache and retry
