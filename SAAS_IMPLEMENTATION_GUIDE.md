# üöÄ Multi-Tenant SaaS Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### **1. Multi-Tenant Architecture** ‚úÖ

#### **Organization Model**
- Companies can sign up and create their own organization
- Each organization has:
  - Unique name and slug (URL-friendly identifier)
  - Owner, members, and role-based access
  - Subscription plan (FREE, STARTER, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE)
  - Usage limits (max users, max projects)
  - Custom settings and branding

#### **Organization Members**
- Users can belong to multiple organizations
- Role-based access control:
  - **OWNER**: Full control, can delete organization
  - **ADMIN**: Can manage settings and invite users
  - **MEMBER**: Can create and manage projects
  - **VIEWER**: Read-only access

#### **User Invitations**
- Admins can invite users via email
- Invitation system with:
  - Unique tokens
  - 7-day expiration
  - Email notifications (Lambda function)
  - Accept/reject functionality

---

### **2. Updated Data Schema** ‚úÖ

#### **New Models Added**:

```typescript
// Organization (Multi-tenant container)
Organization {
  name, slug, description
  logoUrl, website, industry
  size: SMALL | MEDIUM | LARGE | ENTERPRISE
  plan: FREE | STARTER | PROFESSIONAL | ENTERPRISE
  ownerId, maxUsers, maxProjects
  isActive, settings (JSON)
}

// OrganizationMember (User-Organization relationship)
OrganizationMember {
  organizationId, userId
  role: OWNER | ADMIN | MEMBER | VIEWER
  invitedBy, joinedAt
}

// Invitation (Email invitations)
Invitation {
  organizationId, email, role
  invitedBy, token
  status: PENDING | ACCEPTED | EXPIRED | REVOKED
  expiresAt
}
```

#### **Updated Models**:
- **Project**: Now belongs to an organization (`organizationId`)
- **UserProfile**: Enhanced with phone, timezone, lastLoginAt
- **Task**: Added import fields (startDate, estimatedHours, actualHours, progressPercentage, completedAt)

---

### **3. Lambda Functions** ‚úÖ

#### **send-invitation**
- Sends email invitations to new users
- Uses AWS SES for email delivery
- Creates invitation record in DynamoDB
- Generates secure invitation tokens

**Location**: `client/amplify/functions/send-invitation/`

#### **accept-invitation**
- Validates invitation tokens
- Creates organization membership
- Updates invitation status
- Handles expiration logic

**Location**: `client/amplify/functions/accept-invitation/`

---

### **4. React Components** ‚úÖ

#### **OrganizationSetup** (`/organization-setup`)
- 3-step wizard for creating organizations:
  1. Company information
  2. Team size selection
  3. Plan selection
- Auto-generates URL slug from company name
- Creates organization and owner membership

#### **InviteUsersModal**
- Modal for inviting team members
- Supports multiple emails (comma or newline separated)
- Role selection (Admin, Member, Viewer)
- Shows success/failure results

---

### **5. Excel Import Fix** ‚úÖ

#### **Date Parsing**
- Fixed "Invalid time value" errors
- Handles Excel serial dates (numeric format)
- Handles string dates
- Validates dates before conversion

#### **Field Mapping**
- Maps Excel columns to Task fields
- Supports custom column names
- Handles missing/optional fields

## üîß Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Deploy Updated Schema**

The schema has been updated with multi-tenant models. Deploy it:

```bash
# Amplify will automatically detect changes
# Build will deploy new schema to DynamoDB
```

### **Step 2: Configure AWS SES**

For email invitations to work:

1. **Verify Email Address**:
   ```bash
   aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Move Out of Sandbox** (for production):
   - Go to AWS SES Console
   - Request production access
   - This allows sending to any email address

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - `FROM_EMAIL`: Your verified email
   - `APP_URL`: Your app URL

### **Step 3: Update Routes**

Add new routes to `App.js`:

```javascript
import OrganizationSetup from './pages/OrganizationSetup';

// In Routes:
<Route path="/organization-setup" element={<OrganizationSetup />} />
```

### **Step 4: Add Organization Check**

Update your authentication flow to check if user has an organization:

```javascript
// After login, check if user has organization
const { data: memberships } = await client.models.OrganizationMember.list({
  filter: { userId: { eq: user.userId } }
});

if (memberships.length === 0) {
  navigate('/organization-setup');
} else {
  navigate('/modern-dashboard');
}
```

## üîê Security & Access Control

### **Row-Level Security**
- All queries filtered by organizationId

- Cognito authentication required

### **Role-Based Access**
```javascript
// Check user role before actions
const canInviteUsers = ['OWNER', 'ADMIN'].includes(userRole);
const canCreateProjects = ['OWNER', 'ADMIN', 'MEMBER'].includes(userRole);
const canDeleteOrg = userRole === 'OWNER';
```

### **Data Isolation**
- Each organization's data is completely isolated
- Projects belong to organizations
- Tasks belong to projects (which belong to organizations)
- No cross-organization data leakage

---

## üéØ User Flows

### **New Company Signup**
1. User signs up with Cognito
2. Redirected to `/organization-setup`
3. Creates organization (3-step wizard)
4. Becomes organization OWNER
5. Can invite team members
6. Redirected to dashboard

### **Invited User Signup**
1. Receives invitation email
2. Clicks invitation link
3. Signs up with Cognito (if new user)
4. Invitation automatically accepted
5. Added to organization as MEMBER/ADMIN
6. Redirected to dashboard

### **Existing User Invitation**
1. Receives invitation email
2. Logs in to existing account
3. Accepts invitation
4. Now member of multiple organizations
5. Can switch between organizations

---

## üìß Email Templates

---

## üîÑ Migration Path

### **For Existing Users**
1. Create a default organization for each existing user
2. Migrate their projects to their organization
3. Update all project references

```javascript
// Migration script (run once)
const migrateExistingUsers = async () => {
  const users = await client.models.UserProfile.list();
  
  for (const user of users) {
    // Create organization
    const org = await client.models.Organization.create({
      name: `${user.firstName}'s Organization`,
      slug: `${user.email.split('@')[0]}-org`,
      ownerId: user.id,
      plan: 'FREE',
      maxUsers: 5,
      maxProjects: 3,
    });
    
    // Create membership
    await client.models.OrganizationMember.create({
      organizationId: org.id,
      userId: user.id,
      role: 'OWNER',
    });
    
    // Update user's projects
    const projects = await client.models.Project.list({
      filter: { ownerId: { eq: user.id } }
    });
    
    for (const project of projects) {
      await client.models.Project.update({
        id: project.id,
        organizationId: org.id,
      });
    }
  }
};
```

## üí≥ Billing Integration (TODO)

### **Stripe Integration**
```javascript
// Add to organization model
stripeCustomerId
stripeSubscriptionId
billingCycle: MONTHLY | ANNUAL
nextBillingDate
```

### **Usage Tracking**
```javascript
// Track usage
currentUsers: count of active members
currentProjects: count of active projects
storageUsed: total file storage
```

### **Upgrade Flow**
1. User clicks "Upgrade"
2. Redirected to Stripe Checkout
3. Webhook updates organization plan
4. Limits automatically increased
