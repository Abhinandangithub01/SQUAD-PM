# 🚀 Complete AWS Amplify Setup - Step by Step

**Goal:** Fix all errors and deploy production-ready app

---

## ⚠️ **Current Issues**

1. ❌ Amplify not configured - `amplify_outputs.json` missing
2. ❌ Backend server errors (port 5000)
3. ❌ Channel creation failing
4. ❌ No AWS resources deployed

---

## 📋 **STEP 1: Install Amplify CLI**

```bash
# Install Amplify CLI globally
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# Verify installation
amplify --version
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 2: Configure AWS Credentials**

```bash
# Configure Amplify with your AWS account
amplify configure
```

**Follow the prompts:**
1. Sign in to AWS Console (opens browser)
2. Create IAM user with AdministratorAccess
3. Copy Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
4. Enter in terminal
5. Choose region: `us-east-1`
6. Enter profile name: `default`

---

## 📋 **STEP 3: Initialize Amplify in Project**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd c:\Users\mail2\Downloads\ProjectManagement

# Initialize Amplify
amplify init
```

**Answer prompts:**
```
? Enter a name for the project: ProjectManagement
? Initialize the project with the above configuration? No
? Enter a name for the environment: dev
? Choose your default editor: Visual Studio Code
? Choose the type of app that you're building: javascript
? What javascript framework are you using: react
? Source Directory Path: client/src
? Distribution Directory Path: client/build
? Build Command: npm run build
? Start Command: npm start
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Yes
? Please choose the profile you want to use: default
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 4: Add Authentication (Cognito)**

```bash
amplify add auth
```

**Choose:**
```
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Email
? Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 5: Add API (GraphQL with DynamoDB)**

```bash
amplify add api
```

**Choose:**
```
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: GraphQL
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue: Continue
? Choose a schema template: Single object with fields (e.g., "Todo" with ID, name, description)
? Do you want to edit the schema now? Yes
```

**Replace the schema with your existing one:**
- Copy content from `amplify/backend/api/schema.graphql`
- Or use the schema you already have

**Important settings:**
```
? Configure conflict detection? Yes
? Select the default resolution strategy: Auto Merge
? Do you want to enable DataStore for offline and sync? No
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 6: Add Storage (S3)**

```bash
amplify add storage
```

**Choose:**
```
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
? Provide a friendly name for your resource: projectfiles
? Provide bucket name: projectmanagement-files-[unique-id]
? Who should have access: Auth users only
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? create/update, read, delete
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? No
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 7: Push to AWS (Deploy Everything)**

```bash
amplify push
```

**This will:**
- ✅ Create Cognito User Pool
- ✅ Create AppSync GraphQL API
- ✅ Create DynamoDB tables (User, Project, Task, Channel, Message, etc.)
- ✅ Create S3 bucket
- ✅ Generate `amplify_outputs.json` or `aws-exports.js`
- ✅ Set up all IAM roles and permissions

**Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment...**

---

## 📋 **STEP 8: Verify Configuration Files**

After `amplify push`, check for these files:

```bash
# Check for configuration file
ls client/src/aws-exports.js
# OR
ls client/src/amplify_outputs.json
```

**If file exists:** ✅ Configuration complete!

**If file doesn't exist:**
```bash
amplify pull
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 9: Update index.js (if needed)**

**If you have `aws-exports.js`:**
```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

**If you have `amplify_outputs.json`:**
```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from './amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 10: Fix Channel Creation**

The channel creation is already fixed in the code, but let's verify:

**Check `amplifyDataService.js` has this:**
```javascript
// Build channel input with only non-null values
const channelInput = {
  name: channelData.name,
  description: channelData.description || '',
  type: channelData.type || 'GENERAL',
  createdById: channelData.createdById,
};

// Only add projectId if it has a value (GSI requirement)
if (channelData.projectId) {
  channelInput.projectId = channelData.projectId;
}
```

---

## 📋 **STEP 11: Test the Application**

```bash
# Start the app
cd client
npm start
```

**Test checklist:**
1. ✅ Register new user
2. ✅ Login
3. ✅ Create project
4. ✅ Create task
5. ✅ Open chat
6. ✅ Channels auto-create
7. ✅ Send message

---

## 📋 **STEP 12: Deploy to Production**

```bash
# Add hosting
amplify add hosting

# Choose:
# - Hosting with Amplify Console (Managed hosting with CI/CD)
# - Manual deployment

# Publish
amplify publish
```

**Your app will be live at:**
`https://[branch].[app-id].amplifyapp.com`

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "Amplify has not been configured"**
```bash
# Re-run push
amplify push

# Or pull configuration
amplify pull
```

### **Error: "Cannot find module aws-exports"**
```bash
# Generate configuration
amplify pull

# Or check if file exists
ls client/src/aws-exports.js
```

### **Error: "User pool does not exist"**
```bash
# Check auth status
amplify status

# Re-add auth if needed
amplify remove auth
amplify add auth
amplify push
```

### **Error: "GraphQL endpoint not found"**
```bash
# Check API status
amplify status

# Update API
amplify update api
amplify push
```

### **Error: "Channel creation failed"**
- Verify user is logged in
- Check `createdById` is provided
- Don't send `projectId` if null
- Check console for detailed error

---

## 📊 **Verify Deployment**

### **Check AWS Console:**

1. **Cognito:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito
   - Verify User Pool exists
   - Check users can register

2. **AppSync:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync
   - Verify API exists
   - Test queries in console

3. **DynamoDB:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb
   - Verify tables exist:
     - User
     - Project
     - Task
     - Channel
     - Message
     - Comment
     - Attachment

4. **S3:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3
   - Verify bucket exists
   - Check CORS configuration
